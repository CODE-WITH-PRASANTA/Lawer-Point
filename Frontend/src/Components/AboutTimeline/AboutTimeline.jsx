      description: `
        In 2019, we initiated our journey by building a strong legal and structural foundation. This involved extensive research on the Indian corporate legal ecosystem, including types of business entities, registration requirements, and compliance regulations. We consulted with legal experts to understand the Company Act, 2013 and planned our entity formation roadmap. Simultaneously, we drafted preliminary internal policies on data security, privacy, and business ethics.`

       The year 2020 marked our official legal entry into the market as we registered the business as a Private Limited Company under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). We obtained our Certificate of Incorporation (CIN), PAN, TAN, GSTIN, and opened a corporate bank account. Alongside, we filed the Memorandum and Articles of Association, defined shareholder roles, and ensured proper board resolution documentation to initiate lawful operations.`

        In 2021, we developed and implemented all major legal contracts and agreements. This included legally binding Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), Master Service Agreements (MSAs), client onboarding contracts, vendor agreements, and employee offer letters with confidentiality clauses. We consulted external law firms to ensure our documentation aligned with Indian labor law, IT Act 2000, and international best practices to reduce future legal risk`

       This year, our focus turned toward safeguarding our intellectual assets. We successfully filed for our logo and brand name trademarks and implemented copyright policies for all proprietary digital content and source code. We also ensured that any third-party software or libraries used were in compliance with respective open-source licenses such as MIT, Apache, and GNU.

      description: `
        In 2023, with revenue and client volume increasing, we prioritized statutory and financial compliance. Our company underwent its first independent audit, GST filings became streamlined, and income tax returns were filed quarterly and annually. We conducted an internal legal audit to review contract integrity, IP filings, and compliance with the Companies Act. Our ESOP policy draft was prepared in anticipation of future talent hiring and retention programs.`

      description: `
       As we started expanding globally, 2024 was dedicated to ensuring cross-border legal compliance. We applied for IEC (Import Export Code) registration for international service delivery and established client contracts with dual compliance under Indian and foreign laws. Cybersecurity and data protection became a priority, and we aligned operations with global standards like GDPR and ISO 27001. We also onboarded a data protection officer to manage risk and compliance at scale`

       In 2025, we streamlined our legal and compliance processes through automation and internal legal leadership. A dedicated in-house legal counsel was appointed to oversee contract review, regulatory compliance, IP protection, and legal negotiations. We introduced e-signature tools, centralized contract repositories, policy version control systems, and legal analytics dashboards. These changes reduced legal turnaround times and improved compliance accuracy across departments.`
